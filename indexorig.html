                        Take turns to roll the die as many times as you like. 
                        <br>
                        If you roll a 1 your current score will reset to zero and it's the next player's turn.
                        <br>
                        You can hold your turn at anytime, this will add the score of your current turn to your total score. It will then be the other player's turn.
                        <br>
                        The first person to get their total score over 20 is the winner!
